# A Load-Balancing Mechanism for Distributed SDN Control Plane Using Response Time

## Introduction
This paper addresses the challenges in distributed Software-Defined Networking (SDN) control planes, focusing on improving load balancing through response time-based mechanisms. The distributed nature of SDN controllers can lead to uneven load distribution, which impacts network performance and reliability.

## Methodology
We look into the paper, Load Balancing ina a distributed SDN environment, and analyze it's ideas regarding the strategy that balances the load across multiple SDN controllers by monitoring and adjusting based on real-time response times. This approach considers the dynamically changing characteristics of network traffic and controller loads, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of load distribution.

## Main Results
- Demonstrated that using a load balancer leads to better server utilization. 
- Explores that the solution, SMCLBRT from the paper "A Load-Balancing Mechanism for Distributed SDN Control Plane Using Response Time", effectively balances load in a distributed SDN environment.
- Highlighted the benefits of using response time as a metric for triggering load balancing actions.
